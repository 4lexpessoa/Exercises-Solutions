Source Code for the Exercises and Solutions
==========================================



Directory structure
-------------------

The Exercises directory contains all the code
needed to be handed out at the start of the
tutorial for the exercises to be completed.

The Solutions directory contains sample code
providing an example implementation which
solves the exercises in the lecture notes.

Each directory contains a subdirectory for
each of the exercises. Each of these contains
an implementation of the exercise or solution
in C, C++ and Python.
