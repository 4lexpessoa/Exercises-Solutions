Exercise 7 - Optimize memory movement costs
===========================================

Goal
----
* Use local and private memory to minimize memory movement costs and optimize performance of your matrix multiplication program.

Procedure
---------
* Start with your matrix multiplication program.
* Optimize step by step ... saving intermediate versions and tracking performance improvements.

Expected output
---------------
* A message to standard output verifying that the matrix multiplication program is generating the correct results.
* Report the runtime and the MFLOPS.
