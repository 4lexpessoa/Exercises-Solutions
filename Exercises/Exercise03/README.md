Exercise 3 - Running the Vadd kernel (C++/Python)
=================================================

Goal
----
* To inspect and verify that you can run an OpenCL kernel.
* To learn the C++/Python interface to OpenCL's API's

Procedure
---------
* Take the program we provide you.
It will run a simple kernel to add two vectors together.
* Look at the host code and identify the API calls.
In the C++ version, note how some of the API calls in OpenCL map onto C++ constructs.
* Compare them against the C version (Exercise 2)
* Look at the simplicity of the common API calls

Expected output
---------------
* A message verifying that the vector addition completed successfully.
