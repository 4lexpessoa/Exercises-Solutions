Exercise 2 - Running the Vadd kernel (C)
========================================

Goal
----
* To inspect and verify that you can run an OpenCL kernel.

Procedure
---------
* Take the program we provide you.
It will run a simple kernel to add two vectors together.
* Look at the host code and identify the API calls.
Compare them against the API descriptions on the provided reference card.
* There are some helper files which time the execution, output device information neatly and check (some) errors.

Expected output
---------------
* A message verifying that the vector addition completed successfully.
